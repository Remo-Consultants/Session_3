## üöÄ Flow

1.  **User Input**: The user fills out a form on the frontend with their travel preferences.
2.  **Backend Processing**:
    *   Flask receives the user inputs.
    *   A prompt is dynamically constructed and sent to the **Gemini API**.
    *   Gemini generates the core travel itinerary, cuisine, costs, and tips in a structured JSON format.
    *   The application then calls external APIs:
        *   **Amadeus API** for searching flights and hotels (requires city code lookup).
        *   **OpenWeatherMap API** for fetching a 5-day weather forecast.
    *   All gathered data is combined.
3.  **Frontend Display**: The processed and combined data is sent back to the Flask UI, where it's beautifully rendered in a single-screen, card-based layout.
4.  **Interactive Features**: Users can save/share itineraries or get a "Surprise Me!" destination.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend

-   **Google Maps API**: For interactive destination maps.

### Backend
-   **Python**: Core programming language.
-   **Flask**: Web framework for building the backend API.
-   **Google Generative AI (Gemini API)**: For generating personalized travel content.
-   **Python-dotenv**: For securely managing environment variables (API keys).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)
```bash
# If you have a git repository, clone it first
# git clone <your-repo-url>
# cd <your-repo-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install Flask google-generativeai python-dotenv requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```
_Note: `beautifulsoup4` and `lxml` were included in `pyproject.toml` earlier, but the app does not directly use them in the current version for parsing HTML. They are typically used for web scraping, which is not part of the current API integration. You can install them if you intend to add web scraping capabilities in the future._

### 3. Configure API Keys
Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory with the following content:

```ini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
AMADEUS_API_KEY=your_amadeus_api_key_here
AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your_amadeus_api_secret_here
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

**Where to get your API keys:**
-   **Gemini API**: [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
-   **Amadeus API**: [Amadeus for Developers](https://developers.amadeus.com/) (Sign up, create an application, and get your API Key and Secret). Remember to use the `TEST` environment for development.
-   **OpenWeatherMap API**: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (Sign up for a free account and get your API key).
-   **Google Maps API**: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apiui/credential) (Enable the Maps JavaScript API and Geocoding API, then create an API key).

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
flask run
```
or if your main file is `app.py`:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## ü§ù Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2.  Fill in your travel preferences in the form on the hero section.
3.  Click "Generate My Trip" to get a personalized itinerary, or "Surprise Me!" for a random destination.
4.  View the detailed results including itinerary, cuisine, costs, weather, flights, hotels, and a map.
